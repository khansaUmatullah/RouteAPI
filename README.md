#Project Title: Fuel Station Analysis and Mapping
Description
This project visualizes fuel station data, calculates travel costs, and identifies the most cost-effective fueling options using Python and interactive mapping tools like Plotly. By combining geospatial data and fuel prices, the project provides actionable insights for selecting optimal fuel stops during travel.

Key Features
Data Integration: Processes fuel station data with details like location, retail price, and truck stop names.
Cost Analysis: Computes total fuel expenses based on travel distance, fuel efficiency, and station-specific fuel prices.
Interactive Mapping: Visualizes fuel station locations and their respective prices using Plotly's scattermapbox.
Optimization: Identifies the most cost-effective fuel stop to minimize travel costs.
Customizable: Easily extendable for different datasets or fuel efficiency assumptions.
